# Cryptography I, SU - Programming Assignments

My solutions to the weekly programming assignments of the [Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/) course from [Standford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) on Coursera.

- __Week 1__: implement an attack on [many time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad#Exploits) encryped messages — _[problem](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/quiz/KZ9js/week-1-programming-assignment-optional), [solution](week1-multi-otp-attack.py)_
- __Week 2__: implement [CBC and CTR mode of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) for AES — _[problem](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/quiz/fofQp/week-2-programming-assignment-optional), [solution](week2-aes-cbc-ctr-decrypt.py)_
- __Week 3__: implement a (video) streaming [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) — _[problem](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/quiz/EJ69R/week-3-programming-assignment-optional), [solution](week3-video-online-hashing.py)_
- __Week 4__: implement a [padding oracle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) on CBC MoO — _[problem](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/quiz/5zRcK/week-4-programming-project-optional), [solution](week4-cbc-padding-oracle-attack.py)_
- __Week 5__: implement a [meet in the middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack) to compute a [discrete logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) modulo a prime — _[problem](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto/quiz/7Cjo5/week-5-programming-assignment-optional), [solution](week5-dlog-mitm-attack.py)_
