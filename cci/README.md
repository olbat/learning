# Cracking the coding interview - Personal answers
## About
This are my personal answers to the exercises of the [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) book (isbn: 978-0984782857).

Most of the exercises has been completed with a time constraint (with a time limit varing from 15 to 30 mins) so the code may be dirty, buggy or hard to understand.
